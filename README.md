Advent of Code utilities
========================

Utilities for working with [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles.

The [`aoc_input.sh`](./aoc_input.sh) script follow the automation
guidelines on the `/r/adventofcode` community
[https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation](wiki). Specifically:

  * Once inputs are downloaded, they are cached locally
  * The User-Agent header is set to me since I maintain this tool :smile:
